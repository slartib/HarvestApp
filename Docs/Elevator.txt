Growers
    Have crops that are harvested and stored prior to sale
    The storage can be in commercial elevators or self owned storage tanks or elevators
    The commercial or private storage facilities represent endpoints for each load hauled.
    Growers need to know how much product is hauled to each location.
    They need to know what commercial elevators receive so they know how much crop is credited to their account
    They need to know how much is taken to private storage facilities to know about remaining capacity and how much they have to sell in the future.
    The crops are grown in individual fields 
    The crops have gross type like wheat, lentils, peas, garbonzo beans, canola etc.
    The gross crop type can be represented by mulitple varieties
    A field typically represents a single variety of a gross crop type
    Growers can often be their owner harvesters and shippers
    Growers can also work with custom harvesters and/or shippers for a fee that is sometimes dependent on the amount of crop harvested or shipped
