Project Name: Harvest App

This app will be the first phase of a portfolio app to demonstrate familiarity with a variety of app technologies.

The ultimate purpose of the app will be a management tool for the operations that occur during the harvest of grains in
the Palouse Region of Washington. Actors include, Growers, Land Owners, Harvesters, Shippers, Commercial Storage facilities,
Field Managers, Truck Drivers and others. The users of the app will be individuals that fill the actor roles
previously mentioned. Each actor will have specific requirements for information access and data entry. This will help
reduce some of the manual effort these parties currently use to keep track of harvest activities.

I plan to write my own web services to support the data access. My intent is to make a live connection to a graph
database with the web services but if that proves to time intensive the web services with supply staged data.
